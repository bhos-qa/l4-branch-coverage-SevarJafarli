## Code Coverage

Code coverage shows how much degree of source code has been tested. Code coverage helps to measure efficieny of tests.

## The major code coverage methods are:
<ul>
  <li>Statement Coverage</li>
  <li>Branch Coverage</li>
  <li>Predicate Coverage</li>
</ul>




### Statement Coverage
Statement Coverage is a technique which ensures that all the executable statements in the source code are executed at least once. The important point on Statement Coverage is that it covers all possible paths, lines and statements in the code.

### Branch Coverage
Branch Coverage makes sure that each decision condition from every branch is executed at least once. 

### Predicate Coverage
It is also knows as condition coverage in which all of the boolean expression have been evaulated to both True and False.
